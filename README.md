## Hi, I am Markus! 👋

I am a robotics researcher with many years of R&D experience in robotics motion control, software development for manipulators, and industrial applications (onshore and offshore). <br>
I have worked in the ship industry developing electrical power systems and drives, and in the Oil & Gas sector on subsea control systems. <br>
I enjoy mostly working in the lab (hands-on) with robots and the people around me 💪 . <be>

## Research Interests

Robotics, autonomous systems, robot motion control, whole-body dynamics, trajectory optimization, and simulations.
