## Hi there 👋

I am a robotics researcher with many years of R&D experience in motion control, software development for manipulators, industrial applications, AI, and vision. <br>
I have worked in the ship industry developing electrical power systems and drives, and in the Oil & Gas sector on subsea control systems.
